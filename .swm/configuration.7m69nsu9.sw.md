# Configuration

## `ichrisbirch/ichrisbirch/config.py`

In the Config class, we're setting the env\_file based on the ENVIRONMENT variable. If ENVIRONMENT is not recognized, env\_file will be None. When env\_file is set, pydantic will automatically try to load the variables from the specified file.

Also note that since pydantic automatically converts environment variables to their corresponding data types, we don't need to use Optional or Union in our field definitions anymore.

### Flake 8

`.flake8` cannot be loaded from `pyproject.toml`
