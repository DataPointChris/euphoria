# Running Tests

In order to run pytest, you have to set `ENVIRONMENT=development` so that the config can pick it up and set the correct variables. Note: Config is not actually setting anything in tests, but the config is called in some of the files that are imported and it will error if not set.

## Dev Testing on Mac

*   Make sure to change `/etc/hosts` file: `127.0.0.1 localhost` --> `127.0.0.1 localhost api.localhost books.localhost`

Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To restart nginx after an upgrade: brew services restart nginx Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run: /usr/local/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon off;
