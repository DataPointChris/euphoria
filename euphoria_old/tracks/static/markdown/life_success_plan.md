# Life Success Plan 😄
#wisdom #chris

Determine a Structure – not too rigid so that it seems like a chore in itself, but a way to not have decision fatigue all day deciding on what to do in what order and not having to question if what you’re doing is the most important thing at that time.

Focused Attention – instead of only avoiding perilous things, focus all of your attention on what is important, (should be defined in the structure) and keep your attention on that.  If the process is worthy, it should help hold your attention

Directed Effort – “Deep Work”, “Flow”, “The Zone”, all of these things are pointing to directed effort towards the task using focused attention and not letting distractions or excuses get in the way

Deliberate Practice – Working on weaknesses instead of what you’re already good at or what feels good because it boosts confidence.  If you are secure in yourself then you don’t need a constant confidence boost to alleviate insecurities.

Determine a Structure based on current needs and shortcomings.  Create a breakdown of how to accomplish each task or improvement.  Prioritize wisely, based on logic and reason instead of emotion.  Use the structure to keep pace and the correct ratio of current working topics.
Focus only on the task at hand and direct all effort toward completing that task.  Deliberately practice what is hard, embarrassing, or complex and do not worry about the outcome, only the process.  The outcome will happen naturally when the process has been completed correctly.
Worrying about the future outcome only creates anxiety that hinders current performance and focus.

# Stop focusing on what you want

Instead, focus on who you are. Remember, [you attract who you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lzfRI5lzHY) not what you want. Most people focus too directly on their desires and it creates needy energy that keeps them from getting it. If instead, you just focused on becoming the type of person who deserves what you want, you’d attract it into your life. All success is a byproduct. If you had the attitude that what you want would come to you eventually if you just lived the right way, it would come. This indirect method works much better than coveting success.
